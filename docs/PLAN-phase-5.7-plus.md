# Portal v2 — Phase 5.7+ (post-walk: nav + lineup + tickets + flows)

**Date:** 2026-05-18
**Branch:** `feat/portal-soft-website`
**Status:** 🚧 In progress (Step 1: header)
**Triggered by:** Scott walked the May 18 preview on iPhone after CC's audit closed. Walk surfaced items outside the audit's v1↔v2 parity scope.
**Parent:** [`2026-05-15-portal-v2-completion.md`](2026-05-15-portal-v2-completion.md) — phases 1–5 shipped, parity audit closed via CC handoff
**Mirror:** [`gala/docs/PLAN-phase-5.7-plus.md`](https://github.com/ramonscottf/gala/blob/feat/portal-soft-website/docs/PLAN-phase-5.7-plus.md)

## Why this exists

CC's audit (`docs/AUDIT-REPORT-2026-05-18.md`) closed every documented P0/P1/P2 parity item. Scott then walked the live preview and found a separate set of issues — not parity gaps, but new design direction for v2 to be strictly better than parity. This sub-plan captures and ships them.

CC parity audit closes here. Marking it Phase 5.6 ✅ in parent plan.

## Items (7)

### A. Floating-pill nav header (replaces bottom tab nav + top-left monogram)

Wicko-property pattern.

- Pill on top of every page:
  - Left: DEF/sponsor logo + "Lights · Camera · Take Action · 2026" wordmark
  - Right: hamburger
- Hamburger drawer: **Tickets · FAQ · Settings** (Profile + QR live here now)
- Home is the default view
- **Remove** bottom tab pill (HOME / TICKETS / FAQ)
- **Remove** top-left `SF` monogram (its functionality now lives in Settings)

Implementation: grep `wickowaypoint.com` / `fosterlabs.org` for the existing pill markup + CSS, port to `src/portal-v2/PortalShell.jsx` + `portal-v2.css`. Don't reinvent.

### B. Lineup horizontal rail on mobile (Phase 5.7 queue item)

Proper mobile rail at 390px:
- 2–2.5 cards visible (peek of next)
- `scroll-snap-type: x mandatory`, `scroll-snap-align: start` per card
- Inertia + snap on swipe
- No horizontal page-level overflow

### C. Movie modal — schedule always renders

Currently the modal hides the SCHEDULE block (Early/Late × Auditorium) when the film is in "Pending" state (e.g. Mandalorian/Grogu — image 3). The Pick-CTA gating is fine; the schedule block needs to render above the gating copy regardless.

### D. Tickets — three-dot menu replaces Edit/View

Mirror the group-modal `⋯` pattern.
- Single `⋯` button per ticket row
- Menu items: View ticket, Change seats, Pick meals, Reassign / Gift, Release
- Tap row → opens the group/single ticket modal (existing behavior)

### E. Seat labels on ticket rows

Render seat IDs ("F12 · G12 · G13") on each ticket row, under the showing time / seat-count line. No tap required. (Scott's "missing seats and raw" — confirm on first walk; trivial to revert if wrong.)

### F. QR repositioning — Settings only, troubleshooting framing

**Scott's call:** QR is sponsor-scoped fallback for trouble at the door, not primary check-in. Each group of seats IS the ticket.

- **Remove** the persistent home-page `TicketQrCardV2`
- **Remove** the QR from the per-ticket `ConfirmationView`
- **Add** a QR card to the Settings/Profile page (accessed via hamburger from A)
- Copy framing: "Trouble at the door? Show this QR for check-in."

### G. Fold meal selection into seat picker

**Scott's call:** Current flow (pick seats → commit → Seats Placed sheet → Pick Dinners sheet, stacked) becomes one screen.

- Tap a seat on the seat map → meal dropdown appears for that seat
- Commit fires only when all selected seats have a meal assigned
- Downstream celebration + finalize-confirmation flows unchanged

Touches `SeatPickSheet.jsx` + `SeatEngine.jsx`. Most complex item; saved for last.

## Sequence

1. ✅ Plan committed (this doc)
2. 🚧 A — header (do first; subsequent items land on the new shell)
3. ⏳ B + C — pure layout/CSS
4. ⏳ D + E — TicketsSection refactor
5. ⏳ F — additive in Settings, deletions elsewhere
6. ⏳ G — last

## Status hygiene

No item flips to ✅ Live until Scott walks the deployed change on his phone.
- "✅ Code shipped" = pushed + Pages deploy verified, awaiting Scott walk
- "✅ Live" = Scott confirmed on real hardware

## Not in scope

- Audited parity items (remain shipped from CC's work)
- `SeatEngine` seat-allocation logic
- Delegate / guest-portal flows
- Finalize endpoint behavior, email/SMS payloads

## Status — 2026-05-18 end of session

**Shipped to preview (`feat/portal-soft-website`, deploy `238dd465`):**

- ✅ **A.** Wicko pill nav + drawer (Tickets/FAQ/Settings) — commit `ede2aa3`, walked
- ✅ **F.** QR repositioning to Settings, removed from home + per-ticket — commit `ede2aa3`, walked
- ✅ **B.** Lineup horizontal scroll-snap rail on mobile — commit `4ffb556`, awaiting walk
- ✅ **C.** Movie modal renders Schedule for every film (including Pending) — commit `249f0d1`, awaiting walk
- ✅ **D.** Ticket row ⋯ menu replaces Edit/View — commit `c7a9044`, walked
- ✅ **E.** Seat labels visible on ticket rows — commit `c7a9044` (no JSX change needed; already rendered)
- ⏳ **G.** Fold meal selection into the seat picker — queued for next session; touches the load-bearing 1748-line `SeatPickSheet.jsx`. Deserves its own session.

**Additional fixes shipped 2026-05-18 (commit `bd13ee0`) — post-walk-of-D/E feedback:**

- **Release bug** — `releaseConfirm.returnTo.kind === 'close-group'` was a no-op which left the group modal mounted with stale data. Scott reported "nothing happens when I try to release. Stays on same card. No confirmation." Diagnosis: the seats *were* released on the backend; the UI just didn't reflect it. Fix: `setGroupModal(null)` for both `'close-group'` and the group-emptied-out path. Plus a success toast.
- **Toast confirmations on all destructive/save actions** — new `Toast.jsx` component, top-anchored, auto-dismisses after 3s. Fired on Release, Swap seat, Move group, Gift/Reassign, Invite. Settings save already has inline "Saved." notice from the pages-not-modals refactor.
- **Movie poster cropping** — `.p2-ticket-poster` was a 56px × 2:3 background-cover div, cropping non-2:3 posters (Breadwinner is squarer). Switched to `<img object-fit:contain>` in a 64×96 frame with navy-deep background; clean letterboxing across films.
- **Group modal action consolidation** — Change + Reassign were standalone chips on each seat row alongside ⋯ and the dinner pill. Scott: "Change and reassign should be under the three dots on the ticket page." Done: existing ⋯ overflow menu now hosts Change seat / Reassign-or-Gift / Release; only the dinner pill stays inline.
- **Invite same-group filter** — both `onInviteSeat` (from group modal) and `onInviteNew` (from gift modal) now filter giveable seats to the SAME `theater_id` + `showing_number`. Target seat preselected; other free seats in that group are toggleable pills. Scott: "Default to one, but offer the other seats in that movie/showtime/auditorium."

**Status hygiene:** Items B, C, F-partial-fixes still need Scott's phone walk before flipping to ✅ Live. Items A, D walked already. Items C, E (E confirmed visible in screenshots) walking later.

## Item G shipped — 2026-05-18 (commit `531f045`)

Folded meal selection into the seat picker, closing the last open item in Phase 5.7+.

**Design — opt-in on the shared SeatPickSheet:**
- New `foldMeals` prop on `SeatPickSheet` (default `false`). v1 unchanged.
- v2's `SeatPickerModal` passes `foldMeals={true}`.
- New `mealBySeatId` state map keyed by seat id (e.g. `'F-12'` → `'frenchdip'`).

**UX:**
- Inline meal-picker block renders below the seat chip row when `foldMeals && sel.size > 0`.
- One row per selected seat with the 4 dinner tiles (🥖 / 🥗 / 🌱 / 🧒) as tappable buttons.
- Active state: gold ring + gold-tint background.
- Header line shows live "X / N set" progress.
- Commit button gates on every selected seat having a meal — label flips to "Pick N more meals" until done.
- Deselecting a seat prunes its meal from the map.

**Commit flow:**
- After `seats.place()` succeeds, meals save in parallel via `Promise.allSettled` over the existing `/pick action=set_dinner` endpoint.
- Failures tolerated quietly — sponsor can still edit each seat's dinner pill from the group modal afterwards; refresh catches whatever did save.
- `onCommitted` payload gains `mealsAlreadySaved: true` so any v1 PostPickDinnerSheet host knows to skip the stacked sheet.

**Source:**
- `src/portal/components/SeatPickSheet.jsx` — prop, state, commit hook, inline UI block, Commit gate. ~90 lines added.
- `src/portal-v2/SeatPickerModal.jsx` — one-line prop pass.
- `src/portal-v2/portal-v2.css` — ~95 lines of `.p2-inline-meal*` styles. 4-up tile grid that holds at 390px viewport (tightened padding/font sizes below 480px).
- `DINNER_OPTIONS` reused from `src/portal-v2/DinnerModal.jsx` — one source of truth.

**Build:** 3 vite targets clean. Sponsor bundle `main-BVymp7oP.js` (86KB, +1.6) · `SeatPickSheet-DWGLD325.js` (181KB, +5).

## Mobile modal chrome shipped — 2026-05-18 (commit `fd32356`)

Post-G feedback from Scott walking item G on iPhone: *"opening up in cards on mobile is making navigation hard. can't scroll well. cards are nice on desktop, but mobile is making it hard to navigate. should we rethink the cards? i don't want to deviate mobile and desktop too much."*

**The play:** full-screen the modal chrome on mobile, keep the card chrome on desktop. Same content tree underneath. Responsive-chrome, not divergent-UX. Stripe / Linear / GitHub pattern.

**Mobile (≤640px) — pure CSS overrides:**
- `.p2-modal-backdrop` drops padding + overflow (modal becomes scroll surface), drops `backdrop-filter` (dodges iOS double-blur bug), solid navy background.
- `.p2-modal` edge-to-edge: 100% width, no margins, no border-radius, no shadow. `100dvh` height (iOS Safari dynamic viewport). `overflow-y: auto` + flex column. **All modals scroll as one container — kills the nested-scroll problem.**
- `.p2-modal.stripped::before` (gradient top strip) hidden on mobile — conflicts with sticky header background.
- `.p2-modal-header` sticky top with `padding-top: max(14px, env(safe-area-inset-top))` for iOS notch / Dynamic Island. Title size dropped to 20px so "Pick your seats" fits.
- `.p2-modal-body` `padding: 16px`, `flex: 1 1 auto`, **no overflow declared** (modal owns the scroll).
- `.p2-modal-footer` sticky bottom with `padding-bottom: max(12px, env(safe-area-inset-bottom))` for home indicator.
- Linear-gradient fade on header/footer backgrounds — content fades into them on scroll instead of hard-cutting.

**Desktop (>640px) — unchanged.** Card chrome, backdrop blur, centered 880px max-width.

**Pill auto-hide — one `:has()` rule, fires at all viewport widths:**
```css
body:has(.p2-modal-backdrop) .p2-wpn { display: none; }
```
Solves two problems simultaneously:
1. iOS Safari renders the pill's `backdrop-filter: blur(20px) saturate(160%)` as a **solid black rounded rectangle** when it stacks over the modal's own `backdrop-filter: blur(8px)` — visible top-left of Scott's screenshot.
2. The pill has no purpose while a modal is captive (the modal IS the surface). Removing it from layout when ANY modal is mounted clears visual chrome competition.

`:has()` is supported on iOS Safari 15.4+ (April 2022), well past device floor.

**Scope:** applies to every v2 modal — SeatPicker, TicketGroup, TicketDetail, Invite, Gift, Move, Swap, Release confirm, Movie detail, Delegation manage, Dinner, Profile, Faq-legacy. All share `.p2-modal-backdrop` + `.p2-modal` base. One CSS change covers all. `TicketRowMenu` uses `.p2-ticket-menu` (popover, not backdrop) — pill stays visible for menu opens, as intended.

**Build:** CSS-only delta. 3 vite targets clean. Deploy `4361cd2b` ✅, bundles `main-AMIHTh6C.js` + `main-xfFpB-a4.css` (50.8KB).

## Pill clearance + width match + Gift seats — 2026-05-18 (commit `27a6cfb`)

Post-walk Round 2 feedback: pill wasn't hiding (`:has()` rule didn't fire in Scott's browser), and Manage group needs a Gift action.

**Modal positioning (no more pill collision):**
- Dropped the `:has()` pill-hide approach — wasn't reliable across browsers/caches.
- New approach: pill stays visible always, modals position **below** it via `.p2-modal-backdrop` `padding-top: calc(72px + env(safe-area-inset-top, 0))`. The math: 12px pill top offset + ~48px pill height + 12px breathing, plus iOS notch.
- On mobile the backdrop becomes a solid navy strip at the top where the pill floats, modal fills `100dvh - 72px - safe-area`.

**Width consistency:**
- Scott: *"consistent width"*. Pill is 760px max. Modals were 880px.
- `.p2-modal` `max-width: 760px` (down from 880). Pill + modals now vertically align.
- `.wide` variant unchanged at 1080px — seat picker needs the room for the seat map.

**Gift seats action:**
- **Per-seat ⋯ menu:** "Reassign" / "Gift to a guest" → unified label **"Gift seat"** (and "Gift seat (change recipient)" when a delegate is already assigned). Per-seat Gift now jumps DIRECTLY to InviteModal with the same-group toggle preselecting that seat — bypasses the intermediate GiftSeatModal picker per Scott's spec: *"open a popup preloaded with that seat and give the option of the others in that group."*
- **Manage group dropdown:** new **"Gift {N} seats"** option between Move and Release. Opens InviteModal with every free seat in the group as a toggleable pill, all preselected. User can deselect any, fills guest details, single submit dispatches to every checked seat.
- TicketGroupModal gains `onGiftGroup` prop; PortalShell wires it (filters `g.seats` to non-delegated, sets `seatPills + preselectedPills` both to that list).

**Incidental fix:**
- A rebase artifact left `.p2-auction-burst` `@media` block unclosed — my mobile-chrome block was inserted inside it. Build emitted a CSS syntax warning. Properly closed now. Build clean.

**Build:** Sponsor bundle `main-DUwpGJw7.js` (96KB, +9KB for new gift-flow logic) + `main-CDSyjqqJ.css` (51KB).

## Celebration auction CTA + aud pills + grouped schedule + select-seats button — 2026-05-18 (commit `18af510`)

Post-walk Round 3 — Scott's four polish items, all real wins.

**1. Celebration overlay holds longer + auction CTA**
- `autoDismissMs` default 4500 → 8000ms. Sponsors wanted time to read the seat labels lighting up.
- New optional `onRegisterAuction` prop. When wired, renders **"Register for the auction →"** button between the seat labels and the "Tap anywhere to continue" hint.
- Button uses the red→blue gradient (`var(--p2-red)` → `var(--p2-blue)`). Fades in at 1400ms (settle phase); hint pushed to 2200ms delay.
- PortalShell mounts `AuctionRegistrationModal` at shell level (separate from the `AuctionRegistrationCard` mount on home). Handler: closes celebration, opens auction modal. Embed URL built inline with `first_name / last_name / email` prefill (mirrors `buildEmbedUrl`).
- CTA gated to sponsors who aren't already registered.

**2. Auditorium picker → capsule pills (seat picker step 3)**
- Was two-line cards: "Aud 4 / Standard". Now single-line capsule pills matching the seat-type guide below (Luxury Recliner / Loveseat / Wheelchair / Companion).
- `border-radius: 99`, padding `5px 12px`, font-size 12, font-weight 600. Active state: inset gold `box-shadow`.
- Label format: "Aud 4 · Standard" inline. Scott: *"cleaner, narrower, bring up the top a little."*

**3. Movie detail schedule — grouped by showtime**
- Mandalorian/Grogu had four rows: Early-Aud8, Early-Aud9, Late-Aud5, Late-Aud8.
- Now grouped by `showing_number`. One row per showing with all auditoriums inline as small "Aud N" pills:
  ```
  Early · 4:30 PM   [Aud 8]  [Aud 9]
  Late  · 7:15 PM   [Aud 5]  [Aud 8]
  ```
- New `showtimeGroups` `useMemo` (Map keyed by showing_number, sorted ascending).

**4. "Select seats for this film →" button**
- Footer text *"Pick seats for this film when your selection window opens."* replaced with a primary button.
- Click closes the detail modal and opens the seat picker preloaded to that film. Drops the user straight into the wizard with MOVIE step pre-completed.
- `MovieDetailModal` gains `onSelectSeats` prop. PortalShell wires it: `setMovieModal(null) + setSeatModal({ movieId })`.
- `seatModal` state now accepts `true` (open with no preload) OR `{ movieId, showingNumber? }` (open preloaded). Backwards-compatible — existing `setSeatModal(true)` calls still work.
- `initialMovieId + initialShowingNumber` threaded through `SeatPickerModal` to `SeatPickSheet` (which already supported them).
- Static fallback text retained when `onSelectSeats` prop isn't passed (defensive).

**Build:** Sponsor bundle `main-Ddng_mGF.js` (97.6KB, +2KB) + `main-Bv1InLr4.css` (51.4KB, +0.4KB).
